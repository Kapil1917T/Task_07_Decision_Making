## Post-Season Interview with Coach Kaplan – Reflections and Road Ahead

---

**🎙️ Kapil (Interviewer)**:  
Coach Kaplan, thank you so much for joining us today. What a season it's been for Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse — 14 wins and 6 losses. How would you summarize the team's performance overall?

**🧢 Coach Kaplan**:  
Thanks, Kapil. It’s been a rollercoaster, no doubt. Statistically, we had one of our strongest offensive seasons. Our midfielders stepped up big time, and we averaged over 13 goals per game. But what I’m most proud of is our resilience — especially after that tough March stretch.

---

**Kapil**:  
That March stretch included back-to-back losses to UNC and Boston College. What did you take away from those games?

**Coach Kaplan**:  
Those games were a reality check. Both opponents exploited our transitional defense. We allowed over 16 goals in each of those matches — far above our season average. After that, we restructured our defensive zone and worked on draw controls, which really paid off in April.

---

**Kapil**:  
Speaking of April, your team bounced back with four straight wins, including a nail-biter against Duke. What changed?

**Coach Kaplan**:  
Honestly, it was mindset. We simplified our playbook, empowered our captains to lead the locker room, and focused on fundamentals. Players like Jordan Thomas and Maya Patel had breakout performances. Jordan alone had 9 goals in that month.

---

**Kapil**:  
Looking ahead to next season, what areas are you focusing on during the offseason?

**Coach Kaplan**:  
We're focusing on consistency. While our offense was strong, our shot accuracy hovered around 46% — good, but not elite. Also, our goalie save percentage dipped to 41% in late-season games. So we’re investing in skill development and adding a sports psychologist to the staff.

---

**Kapil**:  
Last question, Coach: any early predictions for standout players next season?

**Coach Kaplan**:  
Keep an eye on freshman Sydney Reyes. She was our top recruit, and even though she had limited minutes this year, she showed incredible composure under pressure. I think she’s going to surprise a lot of people.

---

**Kapil**:  
Thanks for the insights, Coach. We’re all looking forward to next season.

**Coach Kaplan**:  
Thank you, Kapil. Go Orange!
