## 🧾 Claim-by-Claim Breakdown

| # | LLM Claim | Verdict | Notes |
|----|-----------|---------|-------|
| 1 | “One of our strongest offensive seasons.” | ✅ Valid | Backed by 12.37 GPG and 74.7% SOG. Strong metrics overall. |
| 2 | “Midfielders stepped up big time.” | 🟡 Interpretive | Data shows strong performance across top players, but midfield roles not labeled. |
| 3 | “We averaged over 13 goals per game.” | ❌ Invalid | Actual average = **12.37 GPG**. Overstated by LLM. |
| 4 | “Proud of our resilience — especially after that tough March stretch.” | ✅ Valid | March started with 2 losses, followed by 4 wins. Pattern supports narrative. |
| 5 | “Losses to UNC and Boston College with 16+ goals allowed in each.” | ✅ Valid | UNC: 16 GA, BC: 17 GA. Matches game log exactly. |
| 6 | “Opponents exploited our transitional defense.” | 🟡 Interpretive | Defensive breakdown is plausible given high GA, but “transitional” not quantifiable. |
| 7 | “We restructured our defensive zone and worked on draw controls.” | 🟡 Partially Valid | Draw control improvement supported. Defensive changes plausible but not measurable. |
| 8 | “It paid off in April.” | ❌ Invalid | Only 1 win in April; rest were losses. No performance spike observed. |
| 9 | “Four straight wins in April, including a nail-biter against Duke.” | ❌ Fabricated | Only 1 win in April. No game against Duke exists in the log. |
| 10 | “Jordan Thomas scored 9 goals that month.” | ❌ Fabricated | No player named Jordan Thomas in 2025 roster or stats. |
| 11 | “Breakout performances by Jordan Thomas and Maya Patel.” | ❌ Fabricated | Neither player exists in official dataset. |
| 12 | “Shot accuracy hovered around 46%.” | 🟡 Slightly Exaggerated | Actual shot % = **43.7%**. Rounding error or overstatement. |
| 13 | “Goalie save % dipped to 41% in late-season games.” | 🟡 Partially Valid | Overall save % = **43.3%**, but no date-specific breakdown to confirm 41%. |
| 14 | “We’re adding a sports psychologist to the staff.” | ❌ Unverifiable | No data support. Speculative coaching-level statement. |
| 15 | “Freshman Sydney Reyes showed composure despite limited minutes.” | ❌ Fabricated | No such player appears in player stats. Likely LLM hallucination. |
